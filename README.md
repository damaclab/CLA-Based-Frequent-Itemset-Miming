# CLA-Based-Frequent-Itemset-Mining
Implementation of CellFPM (Cellular learning automata based frequent itemset mining) for mining frequent itemsets in a set of transactions in a large dataset is given here.

## Implementation environment
The experiments have been executed on a computer system with specifications of Intel i7-10870H @2.21GHZ, 4 core CPU, and 16 GB Memory. The OS is Windows 10, 64-bit. 

## Comparison algorithms
Comparison algorithms are EClat, FPGrowth*, LCM, DFIN, PrePost, NEclatClosed, NegFIN.
We use the publicly available implementation of these algorithms from SPMF, a publicly available data mining library (https://www.philippefournier-viger.com/spmf/), written in Java.
The implementation for CellFPM is in Java.

## Execution
The following 
### Linux/MacOS

### Windows
