Authors: Moumita Ghosh, Sourav Mondal, Harshita Moondra, Anirban Roy, Kartick Chandra Mondal

## Description
CellFPM is a frequent pattern mining algorithm based on Irregular Cellular Learning Automata. We have successfully adapted the idea of Irregular Cellular Learning Automata and proposed CellFPM to find frequent itemsets from a dataset. The algorithm introduces the notion of frequency and distance between any two items and updates the state of a cell (item) based on previous states of the cell. Here CellFPM has been used for mining frequent itemsets in a set of transactions in a large dataset.

## Execution Environment
The experiments have been executed on a system with the following specifications:
- Processor: Intel i7-10870H @2.21GHZ, 4 core CPU
- Memory: 16GB 2666MHz DDR4
- Operating System: Windows 10, 64-bit

## Comparison Algorithms
Comparison algorithms are 
- EClat
- FPGrowth*
- LCM
- DFIN
- PrePost
- NEclatClosed
- NegFIN.

We used the publicly available implementation of these algorithms from SPMF(https://www.philippefournier-viger.com/spmf/), a publicly available data mining library, written in Java.
The implementation for CellFPM is in Java.

## Pre-requisites
To successfully run the code, the system should have java runtime installed and added to it env variables

## Setup

## Execution
CellFPM can be used for mining frequent patterns in a transaction dataset by executing the following commands:
Command:```java ./```
