# Description
CellFPM is a frequent pattern mining algorithm based on Irregular Cellular Learning Automata. Here CellFPM has been used for mining frequent itemsets in a set of transactions in a large dataset.

## Implementation environment
The experiments have been executed on a computer system with specifications of Intel i7-10870H @2.21GHZ, 4 core CPU, and 16 GB Memory. The OS is Windows 10, 64-bit. 

## Comparison algorithms
Comparison algorithms are 
- EClat
- FPGrowth*
- LCM
- DFIN
- PrePost
- NEclatClosed
- NegFIN.
We used the publicly available implementation of these algorithms from SPMF(https://www.philippefournier-viger.com/spmf/), a publicly available data mining library, written in Java.
The implementation for CellFPM is in Java.
